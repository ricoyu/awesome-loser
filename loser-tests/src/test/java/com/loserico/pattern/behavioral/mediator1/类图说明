The classess which hold reference of the mediator are called colleagues. The major participants of the Mediator Pattern are:

1. Mediator
Defines an interface for communicating with Colleague objects.

2. ConcreteMediator
Implements cooperative behavior by coordinating Colleague objects. It also knows and maintains its colleagues.

3. Colleague Classes
Each Colleague class knows its Mediator object. Each colleague communicates with its mediator whenever it would have otherwise communicated with another colleague.
Colleague接口有一个setMediator(Mediator mediator)方法，Colleague的子类持有一个实例变量private Mediator mediator，再通过实现Colleague的setMediator将具体中介者注入进来.
